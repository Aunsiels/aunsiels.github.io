  <h2>About my work</h2>

  <p>
    I am an Associate Professor at <strong>Télécom SudParis</strong>, part of
    <strong>Institut Polytechnique de Paris</strong>.
    My work sits at the crossroads of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>,
    <strong>knowledge graphs</strong>, <strong>graph learning</strong>, and
    <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I co-direct the <strong>DataAI Master’s program</strong> at IP Paris and direct the
    <strong>MAIA apprenticeship Master</strong> at Télécom SudParis, where I help design
    programs that bridge solid theoretical foundations with real-world applications.
    I care about educational innovation and preparing students to work responsibly with AI.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research interests include commonsense and knowledge-based reasoning, graph-based
    learning, LLMs and NLP, intelligent information systems, and responsible AI.
    More broadly, I am interested in how technology, science, and society interact.
