I am an Associate Professor at **Télécom SudParis**, part of **Institut Polytechnique de Paris**.  
My work sits at the crossroads of **artificial intelligence**, **natural language processing (NLP)**, and **large-scale machine learning systems**.

I currently lead the **MAIA track** (Applied AI Master’s program) and co-direct the **DataAI Master**.  
I design academic programs that bridge solid theoretical foundations with real-world applications, and I care a lot about how we train students to work responsibly with AI in practice.

On the research side, my interests include:

- graph-based learning,  
- large language models (LLMs),  
- intelligent information systems,  
- and responsible AI.

More broadly, I am interested in how **technology, science, and society** interact, and what it means to build AI systems that are both useful and trustworthy.

This website gathers my **research projects**, **teaching activities**, **publications**, and a few **blog posts** or side projects when I have time to write.  
I am open to **scientific collaborations**, **applied research projects**, and **consulting** around AI and data-intensive systems.
